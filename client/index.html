However, due to various reasons, we can only guarantee that prizes can be awarded to teams in the United States. In order for a team to be eligible for UCLA-specific prizes, all members of the team must be current UCLA undergraduate students.\n\n## Rules\n1. You may use any tool, subject to the restrictions below, at your disposal to attempt to solve the problems. We especially encourage the use of free and open-source tools. Google is your best friend!\n2. During the competition, each person may only be a part of **one team** total, and only members of a given team may assist in solving a challenge for that team. Do not share flags, challenge solutions, tips, hints, or otherwise implicitly or explicitly leak information about solving challenges outside your team until after the CTF is over.\n3. Each team must have a valid email address that should serve as the point of contact. UCLA students should use a @g.ucla.edu email to register for access to the UCLA-only division.\n4. There are two divisions for teams, **UCLA** and **Open**. Teams in the UCLA-only division may consist of up to **four** participants, all of which must be **current undergraduate UCLA students**. Open division teams have no team size or makeup restrictions. UCLA students may choose to participate in either division but not both.\n5. No flag or hint sharing. Do **not** accept hints or guidance from anyone except through official support channels.\n6. Do **not** attempt to attack or interfere with other teams or any servers used in this competition that are not explicitly designated for being hacked in a problem. Do not perform any sort of online bruteforce against any of our systems including challenges, such as dirbuster or nmap - it won't help. If you ever have a question about whether something is allowed, please ask!\n7. No brute-force guessing flags. Feel free to try several flags if you're not sure, but don't try any sort of brute forcing on the scoreboard platform.\n8. Finally, **have fun and try and learn something new**!\n\n## Scoring\n1. Each problem has a point value listed. The team who earns the most points wins the competition. If two teams have the same number of points, the tiebreak is which team reached their top score first.\n2. Challenges are subject to **dynamic scoring**: the **more** teams that solve a particular challenge, the **less** points that challenge will be worth to **all** teams who solved the challenge. There is no time score bonus awarded.\n3. The prize winning teams will be contacted by us after the contest ends. Please make sure the email used to register the team is accurate.\n4. We reserve the right to require write-ups from the winning teams for any problems we choose as proofs of solution.\n5. In the event that a team that is ineligible for prizes wins a prize, the next eligible team will recieve that prize. It may take some time for prizes to settle; please be patient!\n6. Anyone who violates these rules will be disqualified. **All decisions made by LA CTF organizers are final**.\n\n## Prizes\nIn order to be eligible for prizes, UCLA teams **must** include all team member email addresses in their team profile at [https://platform.lac.tf](https://platform.lac.tf); open teams will use the email listed in the profile as the prize point of contact.  \nWe reserve the right to require verification of prize eligibility, including, but not limited to, write-ups. Prizes will be given in the form of US Amazon gift cards or by arrangement.  \n&lt;br/&gt;\n**UCLA Division**:  \n- 1st place: $200 + Amber PRO Smart Storage Device + Amber X Smart Storage Device\n- 2nd place: $140\n- 3rd place: $100\n- 4th &amp; 5th place: $80\n- 6th-10th place: $40\nUCLA division prizes will be distributed directly to individual team members. Amounts listed are per team.  \nThere will also be a raffle for CrowdStrike backpacks. Come in-person for a chance to win!  \n&lt;br/&gt;\n**Open Division**:  \n- 1st place: $500\n- 2nd place: $300\n- 3rd place: $200\n- 4th &amp; 5th place: $100  \nOpen division prizes will be distributed to the email linked to the given winning teams. Amounts listed are per team.  \n&lt;br/&gt;\n**Writeup Prizes**:\n- A pool of $400 worth of prize money will be given out via writeup prizes, of which $200 is for UCLA students.\n- Writeup prizes are made out to the individual or group that made and submitted a winning writeup.\n- Writeup judgement will be done by the LA CTF Organizers collectively. Decisions made by the organizers are final.\n- The writeup submission form will be active for 1 week after the CTF is over, and will be posted in our discord.  \n\n## Support\nIf at any point you need to contact us during the competition, please join us in discord at [https://lactf.uclaacm.com/discord](https://lactf.uclaacm.com/discord) and use the #support channel for quick support.\nFor private questions before the competition starts, please email [uclacyber+lactf@gmail.com](mailto:uclacyber+lactf@gmail.com).\n\n&lt;br/&gt;\n\n\n&lt;!--[lactf /div]--&gt;\n\n&lt;!--[lactf div class=\&quot;lactf-sponsors card\&quot;]--&gt;\n\n## Sponsors\nLA CTF would not be possible without all of these amazing sponsors!\n\n&lt;sponsors&gt;&lt;/sponsors&gt;\n\n&lt;!--[lactf /div]--&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;sponsors&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sandia National Laboratories&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;https://static.lac.tf/sponsors/sandia_national_laboratories.svg&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;[**UCLA Affiliate**](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/affiliate-memberships/) &lt;br /&gt; [https://www.sandia.gov/](https://www.sandia.gov/)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Google Cloud&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;https://static.lac.tf/sponsors/google_cloud.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Meet your business challenges head on with cloud computing services from Google, including data management, hybrid &amp; multi-cloud, and AI &amp; ML.
